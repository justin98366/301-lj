# 301 class 5  

Today was a very long, but informative class! I've learned a lot, I definitely did not comprehend everything we learned today; it was so much! I will have to go back and review the code and the comments that were left in it. My portfolio folio is coming along with the basic functionality that i want, I just need to focus on the styling and get it what i want it to be! Other than that, this was a successful first week! On to the next!
