# 301 class 8

Today was A LOT of information. We dived deeper into the backend and i actually enjoy. I'm thinking of getting really good at it and make it my niche. Today was mostly informational and even the lab reflected that. Tomorrow is when thing get more interactive and probably more difficult. But on the bright side, we have 1 and a half weeks until project week!
