# 301 class 10

Today was a very stressful day, definitely of the harder days, if not the hardest. We learned a lot of new things today and new way of doing things, which is pretty much the standard. I have a lot of studying to do because i feel like i need to work on it some more to get a better grasp of if. Next week is the last week of instruction, so I hope i can finish strong!
