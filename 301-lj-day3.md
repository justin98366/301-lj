# 301 class 3  

The past two days I've learned a lot!! It's so much fun learning new things again, but kind of difficult at the same time. Today we learned about event handlers and it a lot!! I'm glad we get to wrap up over the next couple of days and let it sink in.  

My portfolio is coming along, but I want to get more insight on templating before i hash out the HTML file. For now Im just going to try to use class code as a reference!
