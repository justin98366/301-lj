# 301 class 6

Today was a pretty straight forward day. We tipped the iceberg of Ajax and JSON! I look forward to seeing how everything comes together involving Ajax and JSON. Today may have been an easier day, but we were warned that its going to get tough by the end of the week.

I also got some more done to my portfolio. I was able to add some styling that I wanted with the help of my partner. It is coming along nicely now!
