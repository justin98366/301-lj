# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Day one of 301 was a lot of fun. It was great seen some old faces from 201 (which is pretty much majority of the class). I learned a lot of cool new stuff dealing with RWD! It makes a lot of sense to create for the mobile experience first since that where majority of people use the internet now a days! It also make CSS a little bit more fun!

Tomorrow we start jQuery, and I can wait to see how it turns out!
